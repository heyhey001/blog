  <p>Seems like my favourite <a class="reference external" href="http://zedshaw.com/blog/2009-07-13.html">discussion</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://jacobian.org/writing/gpl-questions">is back</a>. In the ring two guys: Zed
Shaw, the developer of lamson and mongrel, on the other side we have
Jacob Kaplan-Moss Django's BDFL.</p>
<p>This time the discussion seems to be entitled &quot;Because the only thing
better than an arbitrarily restrictive license is an ambiguously
restrictive license&quot; [<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/jacobian/status/2598708129">via twitter</a>]. I won't warm up the
discussion with new arguments (promised) but what I found most
interesting about the discussion is <a class="reference external" href="http://zedshaw.com/blog/2009-07-13.html">Zed's blog post</a> why he's using the (A/L)GPL.
Basically what he's saying is that he does not want to be burned again
like he was with Mongrel and uses the GPL to force people to contribute.</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure how that supports freedom. I might be idealistic
here, but what motivates me the most about the open source libraries I
work on is how they are used. I got mails from developers in many
companies that are using various <a class="reference external" href="http://dev.pocoo.org/">Pocoo</a>
libraries internally and cannot contribute patches due to restrictions
in the company structure. Every once in a while I get patches those
developers craft in their free time and very often I don't get any.
However the point is, that I can see people using my stuff which
motivates.</p>
<p>I'm not making money with my libraries, but that's probably because I'm
not a friend of selling code. I love to give the stuff away I'm working
on, and get payed for support if one needs it. And so far this worked
flawlessly for me.</p>
<p>Forcing people to freedom is not exactly my definition of being free.</p>
<p><strong>So dear users: Use my stuff, have fun with it. And letting me know
that you're doing is the best reward I can think of. And if you can
contribute patches, that's even better.</strong></p>
