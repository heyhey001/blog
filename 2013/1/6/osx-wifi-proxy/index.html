  <h1 class="title">OSX as Transparent Wifi MITM Proxy</h1>

  
  <p class=date>written on Sunday, January 6, 2013
  

  <p>Yesterday I was in the situation where I wanted to debug an iOS device
and what network calls it would make.  Normally the trivial step is to
just define an HTTP proxy server in the wifi settings but that will only
work for as long as you have something that actually honors this proxy
server.  But there are better ways to transparently proxy connections from
a device connected via Wifi which does not require any changes on the
actual device.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-tools">
<h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>In order for this to work you need a device running OS X which is
connected to the same network as the Wifi.  Then you need to convince the
Wifi device to see you as the gateway instead of the actual gateway.  The
easiest way is just to go to the settings and change the gateway to your
computer's IP.  The second ingredient is an HTTP proxy, ideally one that
can also decrypt and reencrypt SSL traffic.  Personally I can recommend
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a> for that.  Lastly you will need
another proxy that can work transparently which sits between your device
and Charles.  On OS X <a class="reference external" href="http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/">redsocks</a> gets
this job done.</p>
<p>If you don't want to spend the money on Charles or you want to rewrite
traffic with Python you can use <a class="reference external" href="http://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-setup">
<h2>The Setup</h2>
<p>The first thing you will notice is that when you point your Wifi device to
your computer it will loose network connectivity.  That's because by
default your computer won't forward packets.  This can easily be changed
through sysctl:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</pre>
<p>After that you should be able to browse the internet again on your Wifi
device.</p>
<p>The second step is installing <tt class="docutils literal">redsocks</tt>.  If you have <a class="reference external" href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">brew</a> that's a very trivial operation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ brew install redsocks
</pre>
<p>Once installed you will need to create a config file for it.  Call it
<tt class="docutils literal">redsocks.conf</tt> and place it in a folder from which you run redsocks:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
base {
    log_debug = on;
    log_info = on;
    log = stderr;
    daemon = off;
    redirector = generic;
}

redsocks {
    local_ip = 0.0.0.0;
    local_port = 12345;

    ip = 127.0.0.1;
    port = 8889;

    // known types: socks4, socks5, http-connect, http-relay
    type = socks5;
}
</pre>
<p>Since I'm using Charles I take advantage of it's socks5 support and point
it to <cite>localhost:8889</cite> where Charles normally starts up if configured as
Socks5 proxy.  If you're using a regular HTTP proxy you can use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http-connect</span></tt> as proxy type.  The <tt class="docutils literal">local_port</tt> defines where the
actual transparent redsocks proxy opens.</p>
<p>All you have to do then is to start it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ redsocks
</pre>
<p>After that you will need to point all the traffic that is not from your
computer and from port <tt class="docutils literal">80</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">443</tt> of your Wifi through redsocks.
On OS X the firewall canbe controlled through <tt class="docutils literal">ipfw</tt>.  In my case the
wifi device is <tt class="docutils literal">en1</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo ipfw add fwd 127.0.0.1,12345 tcp from not me to any 80 in via en1
$ sudo ipfw add fwd 127.0.0.1,12345 tcp from not me to any 443 in via en1
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="working-around-os-x-bugs">
<h2>Working around OS X Bugs</h2>
<p>Now currently if you finish that above setup you will notice that nothing
actually works.  The cause for this is a Bug in the OS X kernel that
requires flipping the <tt class="docutils literal">net.inet.ip.scopedroute</tt> flag to <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt>.  I am not
entirely sure what it does, but the internet reports that it breaks
network sharing through the user preferences.  In any case it fixes
<tt class="docutils literal">ipfw</tt> based forwarding so you can flip it with sysctl:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.scopedroute=0
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately in OS X Lion this flag can actually not be flipped from
userspace so you need to set it as boot parameter and then restart your
computer.  You can do this by editing the
<tt class="docutils literal">/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist</tt> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot;</span>
<span class="cp">  &quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;plist</span> <span class="na">version=</span><span class="s">&quot;1.0&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;dict&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Kernel Flags<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>net.inet.ip.scopedroute=0<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/plist&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-ssl-certificates">
<h2>Installing SSL Certificates</h2>
<p>After all that your HTTP traffic should show up in your SSL interception
proxy.  SSL will only work if the application on your Wifi device is
trusting your SSL interception proxy's CA.  For browsers for instance
that's trivial to change.  The Charles Certificate can be added to the
trust store by following this link: <a class="reference external" href="http://charlesproxy.com/charles.crt">charles.crt</a>.  Note that this will not work
with applications that don't use the system's CA trust store.  In that
case you will need to recompile your application so that it trusts the
Charles CA.</p>
