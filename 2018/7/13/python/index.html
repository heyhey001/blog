  <p>Guido van Rossum <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html">announced that he's stepping down as BDFL</a>.
It made me think.  The Python programming language has left a profound
impact on my life.  It's my home, it gave me many of my friendships and
acquaintances.  It gave me my work, supplied me with many invaluable
experiences and it even made me meet my now wife.</p>
<p>As most readers of this blog might know at this blog might know I have a
ambivalent relationship with the language as of a few years ago.  I
learned a lot through Python and one of the things I learned is also
which mistakes one can make in language and interpreter design.  Since I
know Python in and out it's not hard for me to see all the things that did
not go well.  However nothing is perfect.  The things that might be ugly in
the language or implementation also have some unexpected benefits.
Python has a pretty weak story on package distribution and imports, yet at
the same time this has made the Python community more cautious about API
breakage.  The simplistic nature of the interpreter has cultivated an
environment of countless C extensions that expanded the Python community
in ways that few people would have expected.</p>
<p>Python is Guido van Rossum.  While there have been many contributors over
the years it's without doubt his creation.  You can go back to the
earliest versions of the language and it still feels similar.  The
interpreter design is still the same and so were the influences of the
language.  Python has achieved something that few languages did: it
enabled absolute beginners to start with a language that is fun to pick up
and it stays relevant and useful into ones professional life.</p>
<p>In case you are reading this Guido: I cannot express enough how much I owe to
you.  For all the strong disagreements I had with some of your decisions
over the years please do not forget that I always appreciated it.</p>
