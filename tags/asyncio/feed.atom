    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I started looking into Python's new &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html&quot;&gt;asyncio&lt;/a&gt; module a bit more.
The reason for this is that I needed to do something that works better
with evented IO and I figured I might give the new hot thing in the Python
world a try.  Primarily what I learned from this exercise is that I it's a
much more complex system than I expected and I am now at the point where I
am very confident that I do not know how to use it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not conceptionally hard to understand and borrows a lot from Twisted,
but it has so many elements that play into it that I'm not sure any more
how the individual bits and pieces are supposed to go together.  Since I'm
not clever enough to actually propose anything better I just figured I
share my thoughts about what confuses me instead so that others might be
able to use that in some capacity to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;the-primitives&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Primitives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;asyncio&lt;/cite&gt; is supposed to implement asynchronous IO with the help of
coroutines.  Originally implemented as a library around the &lt;cite&gt;yield&lt;/cite&gt; and
&lt;cite&gt;yield from&lt;/cite&gt; expressions it's now a much more complex beast as the
language evolved at the same time.  So here is the current set of things
that you need to know exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;event loops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;event loop policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;awaitables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coroutine functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;old style coroutine functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coroutine wrappers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;futures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;concurrent futures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;handles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;executors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;transports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition the language gained a few special methods that are new:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__aenter__&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__aexit__&lt;/tt&gt; for asynchronous &lt;cite&gt;with&lt;/cite&gt; blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__aiter__&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__anext__&lt;/tt&gt; for asynchronous iterators (async loops
and async comprehensions).  For extra fun that protocol already changed
once.  In 3.5 it returns an awaitable (a coroutine) in Python 3.6 it
will return a newfangled async generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__await__&lt;/tt&gt; for custom awaitables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's quite a bit to know and the documentation covers those parts.
However here are some notes I made on some of those things to understand
them better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;event-loops&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Event Loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event loop in asyncio is a bit different than you would expect from
first look.  On the surface it looks like each thread has one event loop
but that's not really how it works.  Here is how I think this works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are the main thread an event loop is created when you call
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.get_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are any other thread, a runtime error is raised from
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.get_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can at any point &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.set_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt; to bind an event loop
with the current thread.  Such an event loop can be created with the
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.new_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt; function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event loops can be used without being bound to the current thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.get_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the thread bound event loop, it
does not return the currently running event loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of these behaviors is super confusing for a few reasons.
First of all you need to know that these functions are delegates to the
underlying event loop policy which is globally set.  The default is to
bind the event loop to the thread.  Alternatively one could in theory bind
the event loop to a greenlet or something similar if one would so desire.
However it's important to know that library code does not control the
policy and as such cannot reason that asyncio will scope to a thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly asyncio does not require event loops to be bound to the context
through the policy.  An event loop can work just fine in isolation.
However this is the first problem for library code as a coroutine or
something similar does not know which event loop is responsible for
scheduling it.  This means that if you call &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.get_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt;
from within a coroutine you might not get the event loop back that ran
you.  This is also the reason why all APIs take an optional explicit loop
parameter.  So for instance to figure out which coroutine is currently
running one cannot invoke something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_event_loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;asyncio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_current&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ne&quot;&gt;RuntimeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the loop has to be passed explicitly.  This furthermore requires
you to pass through the loop explicitly everywhere in library code or very
strange things will happen.  Not sure what the thinking for that design is
but if this is not being fixed (that for instance &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;get_event_loop()&lt;/tt&gt;
returns the actually running loop) then the only other change that makes
sense is to explicitly disallow explicit loop passing and require it to be
bound to the current context (thread etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the event loop policy does not provide an identifier for the current
context it also is impossible for a library to &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; to the current
context in any way.  There are also no callbacks that would permit to hook
the tearing down of such a context which further limits what can be done
realistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;awaitables-and-coroutines&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Awaitables and Coroutines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion the biggest design mistake of Python was to overload
iterators so much.  They are now being used not just for iteration but
also for various types of coroutines.  One of the biggest design mistakes
of iterators in Python is that &lt;cite&gt;StopIteration&lt;/cite&gt; bubbles if not caught.
This can cause very frustrating problems where an exception somewhere can
cause a generator or coroutine elsewhere to abort.  This is a long running
issue that Jinja for instance has to fight with.  The template engine
internally renders into a generator and when a template for some reason
raises a &lt;cite&gt;StopIteration&lt;/cite&gt; the rendering just ends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is slowly learning the lesson of overloading this system more.
First of all in 3.something the asyncio module landed and did not have
language support.  So it was decorators and generators all the way down.
To implemented the &lt;cite&gt;yield from&lt;/cite&gt; support and more, the &lt;cite&gt;StopIteration&lt;/cite&gt; was
overloaded once more.  This lead to surprising behavior like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;... &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;... &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;yield&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;go&quot;&gt;[0, 2]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No error, no warning.  Just not the behavior you expect.  This is because
a &lt;cite&gt;return&lt;/cite&gt; with a value from a function that is a generator actually
raises a &lt;cite&gt;StopIteration&lt;/cite&gt; with a single arg that is not picked up by the
iterator protocol but just handled in the coroutine code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 3.5 and 3.6 a lot changed because now in addition to generators we
have coroutine objects.  Instead of making a coroutine by wrapping a
generator there is no a separate object which creates a coroutine
directly.  It's implemented by prefixing a function with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;async&lt;/tt&gt;.  For
instance &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;async def x()&lt;/tt&gt; will make such a coroutine.  Now in 3.6 there
will be separate async generators that will raise &lt;cite&gt;AsyncStopIteration&lt;/cite&gt; to
keep it apart.  Additionally with Python 3.5 and later there is now a
future import (&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;generator_stop&lt;/tt&gt;) that will raise a &lt;cite&gt;RuntimeError&lt;/cite&gt; if
code raises &lt;cite&gt;StopIteration&lt;/cite&gt; in an iteration step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I mentioning all this?  Because the old stuff does not really go
away.  Generators still have &lt;cite&gt;send&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;throw&lt;/cite&gt; and coroutines still
largely behave like generators.  That is a lot of stuff you need to know
now for quite some time going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unify a lot of this duplication we have a few more concepts in Python
now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;awaitable: an object with an &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__await__&lt;/tt&gt; method.  This is for instance
implemented by native coroutines and old style coroutines and some
others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coroutinefunction: a function that returns a native coroutine.  Not to
be confused with a function returning a coroutine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a coroutine: a native coroutine.  Note that old asyncio coroutines are
not considered coroutines by the current documentation as far as I can
tell.  At the very least &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;inspect.iscoroutine&lt;/tt&gt; does not consider that
a coroutine.  It's however picked up by the future/awaitable branches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particularly confusing is that &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.iscoroutinefunction&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;inspect.iscoroutinefunction&lt;/tt&gt; are doing different things.  Same with
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;inspect.iscoroutine&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;inspect.iscoroutinefunction&lt;/tt&gt;.  Note that
even though inspect does not know anything about asycnio legacy coroutine
functions in the type check, it is apparently aware of them when you check
for awaitable status even though it does not conform to &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__await__&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;coroutine-wrappers&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coroutine Wrappers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you run &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;async def&lt;/tt&gt; Python invokes a thread local coroutine
wrapper.  It's set with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;sys.set_coroutine_wrapper&lt;/tt&gt; and it's a function
that can wrap this.  Looks a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import sys
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sys.set_coroutine_wrapper(lambda x: 42)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; async def foo():
...  pass
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; foo()
__main__:1: RuntimeWarning: coroutine &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39; was never awaited
42
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case I never actually invoke the original function and just give
you a hint of what this can do.  As far as I can tell this is always
thread local so if you swap out the event loop policy you need to figure
out separately how to make this coroutine wrapper sync up with the same
context if that's something you want to do.  New threads spawned will not
inherit that flag from the parent thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to be confused with the asyncio coroutine wrapping code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;awaitables-and-futures&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Awaitables and Futures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things are awaitables.  As far as I can see the following things are
considered awaitable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;native coroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generators that have the fake &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;CO_ITERABLE_COROUTINE&lt;/tt&gt; flag set (we
will cover that)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;objects with an &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__await__&lt;/tt&gt; method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially these are all objects with an &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__await__&lt;/tt&gt; method except that
the generators don't for legacy reasons.  Where does the
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;CO_ITERABLE_COROUTINE&lt;/tt&gt; flag come from?  It comes from a coroutine
wrapper (now to be confused with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;sys.set_coroutine_wrapper&lt;/tt&gt;) that is
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&amp;#64;asyncio.coroutine&lt;/tt&gt;.  That through some indirection will wrap the
generator with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;types.coroutine&lt;/tt&gt; (to to be confused with
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;types.CoroutineType&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.coroutine&lt;/tt&gt;) which will re-create the
internal code object with the additional flag &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;CO_ITERABLE_COROUTINE&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we know what those things are, what are futures?  First we
need to clear up one thing: there are actually two (completely
incompatible) types of futures in Python 3. &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.futures.Future&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;concurrent.futures.Future&lt;/tt&gt;.  One came before the other but they are
also also both still used even within asyncio.  For instance
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()&lt;/tt&gt; will dispatch a coroutine to a
event loop running in another thread but it will then return a
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;concurrent.futures.Future&lt;/tt&gt; object instead of a
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.futures.Future&lt;/tt&gt; object.  This makes sense because only the
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;concurrent.futures.Future&lt;/tt&gt; object is thread safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we know there are two incompatible futures we should clarify
what futures are in asyncio.  Honestly I'm not entirely sure where the
differences are but I'm going to call this &amp;quot;eventual&amp;quot; for the moment.
It's an object that eventually will hold a value and you can do some
handling with that eventual result while it's still computing.  Some
variations of this are called deferreds, others are called promises.  What
the exact difference is is above my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do with a future?  You can attach a callback that will be
invoked once it's ready or you can attach a callback that will be invoked
if the future fails.  Additionally you can &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;await&lt;/tt&gt; it (it implements
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__await__&lt;/tt&gt; and is thus awaitable).  Additionally futures can be
cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get such a future?  By calling &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.ensure_future&lt;/tt&gt; on
an awaitable object.  This will also make a good old generator into such a
future.  However if you read the docs you will read that
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.ensure_future&lt;/tt&gt; actually returns a &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/tt&gt;.  So what's a task?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;tasks&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A task is a future that is wrapping a coroutine in particular.  It works
like a future but it also has some extra methods to extract the current
stack of the contained coroutine.  We already saw the tasks mentioned
earlier because it's the main way to figure out what an event loop is
currently doing via &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Task.get_current&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a difference in how cancellation works for tasks and futures
but that's beyond the scope of this.  Cancellation is its own entire
beast.  If you are in a coroutine and you know you are currently running
you can get your own task through &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;Task.get_current&lt;/tt&gt; as mentioned but
this requires knowledge of what event loop you are dispatched on which
might or might not be the thread bound one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not possible for a coroutine to know which loop goes with it.  Also the
&lt;cite&gt;Task&lt;/cite&gt; does not provide that information through a public API.  However if
you did manage to get hold of a task you can currently access
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;task._loop&lt;/tt&gt; to find back to the event loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;handles&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Handles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of this there are handles.  Handles are opaque objects
of pending executions that cannot be awaited but they can be cancelled.
In particular if you schedule the execution of a call with &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;call_soon&lt;/tt&gt;
or &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;call_soon_threadsafe&lt;/tt&gt; (and some others) you get that handle you can
then use to cancel the execution as a best effort attempt but you can't
wait for the call to actually take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;executors&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Executors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you can have multiple event loops but it's not obvious what the use
of more than one of those things per thread is the obvious assumption can
be made that a common setup is to have N threads with an event loop each.
So how do you inform another event loop about doing some work?  You cannot
schedule a callback into an event loop in another thread &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; get the
result back.  For that you need to use executors instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executors come from &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;concurrent.futures&lt;/tt&gt; for instance and they allow you
to schedule work into threads that itself is not evented.  For instance if
you use &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;run_in_executor&lt;/tt&gt; on the event loop to schedule a function to be
called in another thread.  The result is then returned as an asyncio
coroutine instead of a concurrent coroutine like
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;run_coroutine_threadsafe&lt;/tt&gt; would do.  I did not yet have enough mental
capacity to figure out why those APIs exist, how you are supposed to use
and when which one.  The documentation suggests that the executor stuff
could be used to build multiprocess things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;transports-and-protocols&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Transports and Protocols&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always though those would be the confusing things but that's basically a
verbatim copy of the same concepts in Twisted.  So read those docs if you
want to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;how-to-use-asyncio&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to use asyncio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know roughly understand asyncio I found a few patterns that
people seem to use when they write asyncio code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pass the event loop to all coroutines.  That appears to be what a part
of the community is doing.  Giving a coroutine knowledge about what loop
is going to schedule it makes it possible for the coroutine to learn
about its task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alternatively you require that the loop is bound to the thread.  That
also lets a coroutine learn about that.  Ideally support both.  Sadly
the community is already torn of what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to use contextual data (think thread locals) you are a bit
out of luck currently.  The most popular workaround is apparently
atlassian's &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;aiolocals&lt;/tt&gt; which basically requires you to manually
propagate contextual information into coroutines spawned since the
interpreter does not provide support for this.  This means that if you
have a utility library spawning coroutines you will lose context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore that the old coroutine stuff in Python exists.  Use 3.5 only with
the new &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;async def&lt;/tt&gt; keyword and co.  In particular you will need that
anyways to somewhat enjoy the experience because with older versions you
do not have async context managers which turn out to be very necessary
for resource management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to restart the event loop for cleanup.  This is something that
took me longer to realize than I wish it did but the sanest way to deal
with cleanup logic that is written in async code is to restart the event
loop a few times until nothing pending is left.  Since sadly there is no
common pattern to deal with this you will end up with some ugly
workaround at time.  For instance &lt;cite&gt;aiohttp&lt;/cite&gt;'s web support also does this
pattern so if you want to combine two cleanup logics you will probably
have to reimplement the utility helper that it provides since that
helper completely tears down the loop when it's done.  This is also not
the first library I saw do this :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with subprocesses is non obvious.  You need to have an event
loop running in the main thread which I suppose is listening in on
signal events and then dispatches it to other event loops.  This
requires that the loop is notified via
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;asyncio.get_child_watcher().attach_loop(...)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing code that supports both async and sync is somewhat of a lost
cause.  It also gets dangerous quickly when you start being clever and
try to support &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;with&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;async with&lt;/tt&gt; on the same object for
instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to give a coroutine a better name to figure out why it was
not being awaited, setting &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__name__&lt;/tt&gt; doesn't help.  You need to set
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;__qualname__&lt;/tt&gt; instead which is what the error message printer uses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes internal type conversations can screw you over.  In particular
the &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;asyncio.wait()&lt;/tt&gt; function will make sure all things passed are
futures which means that if you pass coroutines instead you will have a
hard time finding out if your coroutine finished or is pending since the
input objects no longer match the output objects.  In that case the only
real sane thing to do is to ensure that everything is a future upfront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;context-data&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Context Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the insane complexity and lack of understanding on my part of
how to best write APIs for it my biggest issue is the complete lack of
consideration for context local data.  This is something that the node
community learned by now.  &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;continuation-local-storage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; exists but has
been accepted as implemented too late.  Continuation local storage and
similar concepts are regularly used to enforce security policies in a
concurrent environment and corruption of that information can cause severe
security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Python does not even have any store at all for this is more
than disappointing.  I was looking into this in particular because I'm
investigating how to best support &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.sentry.io/learn/breadcrumbs/&quot;&gt;Sentry's breadcrumbs&lt;/a&gt; for asyncio and I do not
see a sane way to do it.  There is no concept of context in asyncio, there
is no way to figure out which event loop you are working with from generic
code and without monkeypatching the world this information will not be
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node is currently going through the process of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/pull/18&quot;&gt;finding a long term
solution for this problem&lt;/a&gt;.
That this is not something to be left ignored can be seen by this being a
recurring issue in all ecosystems.  It comes up with JavaScript, Python
and the .NET environment.  The problem &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlQ0R6wQFGqCS5KeIw0ddoLbaSYx6aU7vyXOkv-wvlM/edit&quot;&gt;is named async context propagation&lt;/a&gt;
and solutions go by many names.  In Go the context package needs to be
used and explicitly passed to all goroutines (not a perfect solution but
at least one).  .NET has the best solution in the form of local call
contexts.  It can be a thread context, an web request context, or
something similar but it's automatically propagating unless suppressed.
This is the gold standard of what to aim for.  Microsoft had this solved
since more than 15 years now I believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if the ecosystem is still young enough that logical call
contexts can be added but now might still be the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;personal-thoughts&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man that thing is complex and it keeps getting more complex.  I do not
have the mental capacity to casually work with asyncio.  It requires
constantly updating the knowledge with all language changes and it has
tremendously complicated the language.  It's impressive that an ecosystem
is evolving around it but I can't help but get the impression that it will
take quite a few more years for it to become a particularly enjoyable and
stable development experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What landed in 3.5 (the actual new coroutine objects) is great.  In
particular with the changes that will come up there is a sensible base
that I wish would have been in earlier versions.  The entire mess with
overloading generators to be coroutines was a mistake in my mind.  With
regards to what's in asyncio I'm not sure of anything.  It's an incredibly
complex thing and super messy internally.  It's hard to comprehend how it
works in all details.  When you can pass a generator, when it has to be a
real coroutine, what futures are, what tasks are, how the loop works and
that did not even come to the actual IO part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that asyncio is not even particularly fast.  David
Beazley's live demo hacked up asyncio replacement is twice as fast as it.
There is an enormous amount of complexity that's hard to understand and
reason about and then it fails on it's main promise.  I'm not sure what to
think about it but I know at least that I don't understand asyncio enough
to feel confident about giving people advice about how to structure code
for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
