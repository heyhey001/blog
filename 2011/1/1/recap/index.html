  <p>I have been reading a bunch of people's recaps of 2010.  I find that a
wonderful idea because it turns out that after a year you end up doing a
lot and don't appreciate it enough.  And it turns out, 2010 was an amazing
year.  This is my list of Open Source or programming related activities of
2010:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>January</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Decided to learn game development.  This didn't go too well for a
while though.  I was kinda worn out of Python web development
after four years and wanted to do something new.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>April</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Made an April's fool joke web framework with a screencast that was
downloaded over 15.000 times.  Some people actually took it serious :)</li>
<li>Gave a talk about switching to Python 3 at the Linux days in Graz.</li>
<li>Released Flask, a microframework based on my April's fool joke.  I
learned a lot from that, might be intresting for a talk.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>May</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Attended DjangoCon in Berlin and gave my first English talk ever.
It didn't go as well as it could have been but I was nervous
as fuck, especially because I was the first talk after the
keynote.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>June</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Started looking for a Job over the summer holidays and ended up
working with the guys from Lincoln Loop for a larger Django
project.</li>
<li>Sphinx made it into GSOC under the PSF umbrella and I am mentoring
a student again.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>July</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Attended EuroPython</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>August</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Finally diving into 3D engine development.  The books I bought a
few months back finally pay off and a painful dive into
mathematics starts.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>September</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Broke my macbook, needed replacement â€” expensive month.</li>
<li>Attended DjangoCon and met friends from Portland again.  Good
times.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>October</dt>

<li>Held a talk at Pycon PL about new Python idioms.  Had the chance
to talk to finally meet Maciej Fijalkowski in person and a whole
bunch of interesting guys.</li>
<li>Another talk about Good API Design in Kiev.  First time I was to
Ukraine.</li>
<li>Relaunched pocoo.org with a new design.  Looked for a bunch of
companies using pocoo Software and was proud seeing where our
stuff ended up beeing.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>November</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Got invited to ORD Camp 2011.  Feeling honored, but unfortunately
will not be able to attend :(</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>December</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">

a whole lot that year.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
