  <p class=date>written on Saturday, January 22, 2011
  

  <p>For web applications the safest bet currently is to stick with Python 2.x
even for new projects.  For the simple reason that right now we don't have
enough supporting libraries for Python 3 yet and porting some of them over
is a huge step.  But with all the people telling one that it's hard and
painful to upgrade to Python 3, how does one make this upgrade easier?</p>
<p>For high level applications an upgrade is actually quite simple if it can
trust the supporting libraries to have consistent behaviour after it's
ported to Python 3.  In fact there is no reason why an upgrade to Python 3
shouldn't be possible in a painless way.  So here is a list of dos and
don'ts for writing new Code.</p>
<div class="section" id="is-your-baseline">
<h2>2.6 is your Baseline</h2>
<p>For new projects, start with Python 2.6 or 2.7.  They provide a lot of
things that make an upgrade to Python 3 easier for you.  If you don't have
to support older versions of Python you can already use a lot of the stuff
that is in Python 3 by explicitly opting them in.</p>
<p>You should use the following things from <cite>__future__</cite>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><cite>division</cite>.  I must admit that I hate the future division import in
Python 2.  It constantly makes me jump to the beginning of the
file to check what division mode is active for a module when I do core
review.  However because it will be the default in Python 3 (and the
only mode) you really should be using it nowadays.</li>
<li><cite>absolute_import</cite>.  The most important one.  No longer will <cite>from xml
import bar</cite> import a module <cite>foo.xml</cite> from the <cite>foo</cite> package when you
are inside it.  Instead you explicitly have to do <cite>from .xml import
bar</cite> to get to what you want.  Less confusion and incredible helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the print-as-a-function future import, I recommend against using
it to avoid confusion.  Especially because all editors are currently
highlighting it as a keyword it can become confusing quickly.  Generally
if things behave differently in different files it's a good idea to avoid
these things if possible.  The great aspect of the print change is that it
can be reliably converted with 2to3, so there is really no reason to use
the <cite>print_function</cite> future import.</p>
<p>While it might be appealing, better do not use the <cite>unicode_literals</cite>
future import.  For the very simple reason that may APIs are changing the
supported string types in different places and <cite>unicode_literals</cite> is
counterproductive.  There are of course places where this feature import
is useful, but that's more limited to lower level interfaces (libraries)
and those can't use that import anytime soon anyways because it came with
Python 2.6.  To get access to the <tt class="docutils literal">b'foo'</tt> iteral you <em>do not need</em> this
specific import.  That is available either way and is a great help for
2to3.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-io-and-unicode">
<h2>File IO and Unicode</h2>
<p>File IO changed greatly in Python 3.  Thankfully if you are designing new
APIs for new projects you can save yourself a lot of hassle by deciding
explicitly for unicode.</p>
<p>If you are dealing with text data, use the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/codecs.html">codecs.open</a> function for opening the
files.  Assume utf-8 encoding unless explicitly differently defined and
operate on unicode strings only.  For binary IO make sure to open the file
with <tt class="docutils literal">'rb'</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">'r'</tt> and you are set.  That was required for
proper Windows support already anyways.</p>
<p>If you are doing byte based data processing mark strings that are bytes
only with <tt class="docutils literal">b'foo'</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">'foo'</tt> which tells 2to3 to not convert
these string literals to unicode.  Please be aware of the following
differences between Python 2.6:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span>
<span class="go">&#39;foo&#39;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">&#39;f&#39;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;bar&#39;</span>
<span class="go">u&#39;foobar&#39;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">[&#39;f&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;o&#39;]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>and Python 3 regarding byte strings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">102</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;bar&#39;</span>
<span class="gt">Traceback (most recent call last):</span>
  File <span class="nb">&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span>, line <span class="m">1</span>, in <span class="n">&lt;module&gt;</span>
<span class="gr">TypeError</span>: <span class="n">can&#39;t concat bytes to str</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">[102, 111, 111]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As a replacement for the above Python 2 idioms, you can use this instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">b&#39;f&#39;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;latin1&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">b&#39;foobar&#39;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">to_charlist</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">))]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">to_charlist</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">[b&#39;f&#39;, b&#39;o&#39;, b&#39;o&#39;]</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These will work on both 2.6 and 3.x.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="better-safe-than-sorry">
<h2>Better Safe than Sorry</h2>
<p>There are a couple of things where 2to3 will be pretty counterproductive.
Some of these are cases where 2to3 seems to have a bug, others are the
cases where it just does not know enough of your code to make proper
predictions.</p>
<div class="section" id="recursion-error-with-str">
<h3>Recursion Error with str</h3>
<p>A lot of people are using code like this on Python 2:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__str__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">unicode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__unicode__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>2to3 assumes that your API is not unicode compatible and will convert it
to this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__str__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__unicode__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello World&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now this is just wrong.  First of all <cite>__unicode__</cite> is unused in Python 3,
secondly <cite>__str__</cite> now calls into itself and will trigger a runtime error
because of recursion when <cite>str()</cite> is called on an instance of <cite>Foo</cite>.  This
can be solved with either a custom 2to3 fixer or a little helper class
that makes a check for Python 3:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UnicodeMixin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">version_info</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="fm">__str__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="fm">__unicode__</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="fm">__str__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">unicode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">UnicodeMixin</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__unicode__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello World&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That way your object will still have an <cite>__unicode__</cite> attribute on Python
3, but that will not do any harm.  When you then want to drop Python 2
support you just have to go over all subclasses of <cite>UnicodeMixin</cite> and
rename <cite>__unicode__</cite> to <cite>__str__</cite> and remove the helper class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="string-comparisons">
<h3>String Comparisons</h3>
<p>This problem is a little more tricky.  In Python 2 the following is true:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Not so in Python 3:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span>
<span class="go">False</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What's worse here is that Python 2 does not emit a warning on comparisons
(neither with or without Python-3-warnings flag) and neither will Python
3.  So how can you spot these cases?  I wrote a small helper module called
<a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicode-nazi">unicode-nazi</a> which once
imported will warn automatically if you do something that is not purely
a unicode or bytestring operation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unicodenazi</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">u</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span>
<span class="go">__main__:1: UnicodeWarning: Implicit conversion of str to unicode</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
<p>But be aware that this module is very noisy and has a noticeable runtime
overhead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-string">
<h2>What is a String?</h2>
<p>Here a table of things that are bytestrings and what they usually become

</div>
<div class="section" id="latin1-is-special">
<h2>Latin1 is Special</h2>
<p>In some places (WSGI for instance) there is now the notion of unicode
strings that must only be a subset of latin1.  That's the case because the
HTTP spec is not very clear on encodings and it was decided to assume
latin1 to be safe.  If you control both ends of the communication (like
you do with cookies) you can of course use utf-8 if you like.  So how does
this work if the header is limited to latin1?  For Python 3 (and only for
Python 3) you will need to apply a little trick:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">cookie_value</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;latin1&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That way you just fake encoded utf-8 into a unicode string.  The WSGI
layer will then again encode this string as latin1 and you are
transmitting wrong utf-8 as latin1 over the wire.  If you do the inverse
of that trick on the receiving end it will work.</p>
<p>That's of course ugly, but that's pretty much how utf-8 in headers already
worked.  And it's really just the cookie header that is affected by that,
and that header was unreliable anyways.</p>
<p>The only other place in WSGI where this will become an issue is the
<cite>PATH_INFO</cite> / <cite>SCRIPT_NAME</cite> tuple, but your framework should figure that
out for you when it's working on Python 3.</p>
