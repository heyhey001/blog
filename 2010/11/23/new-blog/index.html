  <p class=date>written on Tuesday, November 23, 2010
  

  <p>I really wanted to stop giving status updates like this on my blog as
irrelevant information is much better suited for twitter, but let this be
the last exception.  I used to use my own blog software “Zine” on this
website but after a while I had to recognice that I hate traditional
weblog software.  When I started blogging a few years ago I used wordpress
like everybody else did.  I also used subversion (if at all) and generally
the world was a different place.</p>
<p>I always thought it would be a huge plus to be able to edit your blog
posts online from any computer.  However I no longer have the urge to
update my blog from a random location, instead I want to use this place to
share things I learned, little stories, useful experiences and other
things.  And all that requires careful proof reading and because it takes
time, there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to do that on my personal
notebook and my favourite text editor.</p>
<p>For random outbursts I now have Twitter, and that fulfills it's role
perfectly.</p>
<p>The other new thing on this website is, that it's no longer featuring user
comments.  There are a couple of reasons for that.  First of all 98% of
all comments submitted on my old blog were spam.  Secondly however I don't
really want user feedback to show up on my website.  Not because I am
afraid of user feedback, but because I think these discussions should go
to dedicated channels such as mailinglists, reddit and other websites.</p>
<p>Lastly that way I don't waste valuable CPU time on our already overloaded
pocoo box and can move the blog around as necessary.</p>
<p>In case you are interested in the script that generates this website, head
over to <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog">it's github page</a>.</p>
<p>But where did the existing content go?  I am currently in the process of
sorting out useful blog posts and useless stuff I posted here.  The former
will come back, nicely formatted and updated as necessary, the rest will
move to a different URL with the original site design and comments
preserved.</p>
